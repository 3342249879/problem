*Problem* is a library that implements [`application/problem+json`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-07).
It comes with an extensible set of interfaces/implementations as well as convenient functions for every day use.
It's decoupled from any JSON library, but contains a separate module for Jackson.

## Note

The term problem in this document, in contrast to the [`application/problem+json`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-07) spec **requires** the properties `type`, `title` and `status`.

## Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>problem</artifactId>
    <version>${problem.version}</version>

</dependency>
```

## Usage

There are different ways to express problems. Ranging from limited, but easy-to-use to highly flexible and extensible, yet with slightly more effort:

### Generic

There are cases in which an [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) is basically enough to convey the necessary information. Everything you need is the status you want to repond with and we will create a problem from it:

```java
Problem.valueOf(Status.NOT_FOUND);
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": "http://httpstatus.es/404",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404
}
```

[httpstatus.es](http://httpstatus.es/) is a convenient little site that has a unique URI for every status code which includes some information about it. A perfect match for our use case.

But you may also have the need to add some little hint, e.g. as a custom detail of the problem:

```java
Problem.valueOf(Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, "Database not reachable");
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": "http://httpstatus.es/503",
  "title": "Service Unavailable",
  "status": 503,
  "detail": "Database not reachable"
}
```

### Builder

Most of the time you'll need to define specific problem types, that are unique to your application. And you want to construct problems in a more flexible way. This is where the *Problem Builder* comes into play. It ofers a fluent API and allows to construct problem instances without the need to create custom classes:

```java
Problem.builder()
    .withType(URI.create("http://example.org/out-of-stock"))
    .withTitle("Out of Stock")
    .withStatus(UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
    .withDetail("Item B00027Y5QG is no longer available")
    .build();
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": ""http://example.org/out-of-stock",
  "title": "Out of Stock",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Item B00027Y5QG is no longer available"
}
```

Right now the builder does **not** allow to add custom properties, i.e. others than `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail` and `instance`. This may change in the future.

### Custom Problems

The highest degree of flexibility and customizability is achieved by implementing `Problem` directly. This is especially convenient if you refer to it in a lot of places, i.e. it makes it easier to share.

```java
@Immutable
@JsonTypeName(OutOfStockProblem.TYPE_VALUE)
public final class OutOfStockProblem implements Problem {

    static final String TYPE_VALUE = "http://example.org/out-of-stock";
    static final URI TYPE = URI.create(TYPE_VALUE);

    private final Optional<String> detail;
    private final String product;

    @JsonCreator
    public OutOfStockProblem(final String detail, final String product) {
        this.detail = Optional.of(detail);
        this.product = product;
    }

    @Override
    public URI getType() {
        return TYPE;
    }

    @Override
    public String getTitle() {
        return "Out of Stock";
    }

    @Override
    public StatusType getStatus() {
        return MoreStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<String> getDetail() {
        return detail;
    }
    
    public String getProduct() {
        return product;
    }

}
```

If you're using the supplied Jackson Module: Make sure you register your custom sub types with the ObjectMapper:

```java
mapper.registerSubtypes(OutOfStockProblem.class);
```

### Throwing Problems

*Problems* have loose, yet direct connection to *Exceptions*. Most of the time you'll find yourself transforming one into the other. To make this a little bit easier there is an abstract `Problem` implementation that subclasses `RuntimeException`: the `ThrowableProblem`. It allows to throw problems and is already in use by all default implementations. Instead of implementing the `Problem` interface, just inherit from `ThrowableProblem`:

```java
public final class OutOfStockProblem extends ThrowableProblem {
```

## Deserialization

`DefaultProblem` (extends ThrowableProblem).
