*Problem* is a library that implements [`application/problem+json`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-07).
It comes with an extensible set of interfaces/implementations as well as convenient functions for every day use.
It's decoupled from any JSON library, but contains a separate module for Jackson.

## Note

The term problem in this document, in contrast to the [`application/problem+json`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-07) spec **requires** the properties `type`, `title` and `status`.

## Creating problems

There are different ways to express problems. Ranging from limited, but easy-to-use to highly flexible and extensible, yet with slightly more effort:

### Generic

There are cases in which an [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) is basically enough to convey the necessary information. Everything you need is the status you want to repond with and we will create a problem from it:

```java
Problem.valueOf(Status.NOT_FOUND);
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": "http://httpstatus.es/404",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404
}
```

[httpstatus.es](http://httpstatus.es/) is a convenient little site that has a unique URI for every status code which includes some information about it. A perfect match for our use case.

But you may also have the need to add some little hint, e.g. as a custom detail of the problem:

```java
Problem.valueOf(Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, "Database not reachable");
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": "http://httpstatus.es/503",
  "title": "Service Unavailable",
  "status": 503,
  "detail": "Database not reachable"
}
```

### Builder

Most of the time you'll need to define specific problem types, that are unique to your application. And you want to construct problems in a more flexible way. This is where the *Problem Builder* comes into play. It ofers a fluent API and allows to construct problem instances without the need to create custom classes:

```java
Problem.builder()
    .withType(URI.create("http://example.org/out-of-stock"))
    .withTitle("Out of Stock")
    .withStatus(UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
    .withDetail("Item B00027Y5QG is no longer available")
    .build();
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": "http://example.org/out-of-stock",
  "title": "Out of Stock",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Item B00027Y5QG is no longer available"
}
```

Right now the builder does **not** allow to add custom properties, i.e. others than `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail` and `instance`. This may change in the future.

### Custom Problems

The highest degree of flexibility and customizability is achieved by implementing `Problem` directly. This is especially convenient if you refer to it in a lot of places, i.e. it makes it easier to share.

```java
@Immutable
public final class OutOfStockProblem implements Problem {

    static final String TYPE_VALUE = "http://example.org/out-of-stock";
    static final URI TYPE = URI.create(TYPE_VALUE);

    private final Optional<String> detail;
    private final String product;

    public OutOfStockProblem(final String product) {
        this.detail = Optional.of(format("Item %s is no longer available", product));
        this.product = product;
    }

    @Override
    public URI getType() {
        return TYPE;
    }

    @Override
    public String getTitle() {
        return "Out of Stock";
    }

    @Override
    public StatusType getStatus() {
        return MoreStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<String> getDetail() {
        return detail;
    }
    
    public String getProduct() {
        return product;
    }

}
```

```java
new OutOfStockProblem("B00027Y5QG");
```

Will produce this:

```json
{
  "type": "http://example.org/out-of-stock",
  "title": "Out of Stock",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Item B00027Y5QG is no longer available",
  "product": "B00027Y5QG"
}
```

### Throwing problems

*Problems* have loose, yet direct connection to *Exceptions*. Most of the time you'll find yourself transforming one into the other. To make this a little bit easier there is an abstract `Problem` implementation that subclasses `RuntimeException`: the `ThrowableProblem`. It allows to throw problems and is already in use by all default implementations. Instead of implementing the `Problem` interface, just inherit from `ThrowableProblem`:

```java
public final class OutOfStockProblem extends ThrowableProblem
```

## Handling problems

Reading problems is very specific to the JSON parser in use. This section assumes you're using Jackson, in which case reading/parsing problems usually boils down to this:

```java
Problem problem = mapper.readValue(.., Problem.class);
```

If you're using Jackson, please make sure you understand its [Polymorphic Deserialization](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization) feature. The supplied Jackson module makes heavy use of it. Considering you have a custom problem type `OutOfStockProblem`, you'll need to register it as a subtype:

```java
mapper.registerSubtypes(OutOfStockProblem.class);
```
You also need to make sure you assign a `@JsonTypeName` to it and declare a `@JsonCreator`:

```java
@JsonTypeName(OutOfStockProblem.TYPE_VALUE)
public final class OutOfStockProblem implements Problem {

    @JsonCreator
    public OutOfStockProblem(final String product) {
```

Jackson is now able to deserialize specific problems into their respective types. By default, e.g. if a type is not associated with a class, it will fallback to a `DefaultProblem`. 

### Catching problems

If you read about [Throwing problems](#throwing-problems) already, you should be familiar with `ThrowableProblem`. This can be helpful if you read a problem, as a response from a server, and what to find out what it actually is. Multiple `if` statements with `instanceof` checks could be an option, but usually nicer is this:

```java
try {
    throw mapper.readValue(.., ThrowableProblem.class);
} catch (OutOfStockProblem e) {
    tellTheCustomerTheProductIsNoLongerAvailable(e.getProduct());
} catch (InsufficientFundsProblem e) {
    askCustomerToUseDifferentPaymentMethod(e.getBalance(), e.getDebit());
} catch (InvalidCouponProblem e) {
    askCustomerToUseDifferentCoupon(e.getCouponCode());
} catch (ThrowableProblem e) {
    tellTheCustomerSomethingWentWrong();
}
```
